## Architecture Decisions
(Document key decisions here as they're made)

### AD-001: Monorepo Structure
- Using Turborepo for build orchestration
- apps/mobile (Expo), apps/web (Vite React), apps/api (NestJS)
- packages/shared for business logic reuse

### AD-002: State Management
- Zustand for client state (lightweight, simple API)
- WatermelonDB for local-first offline storage
- WebSocket for real-time sync

### AD-003: Styling
- NativeWind (Tailwind for React Native) on mobile
- Tailwind CSS on web
- Shared design tokens via packages/config

### AD-004: Authentication
- Magic link as primary auth for account creators
- Name-only guest auth for frictionless invites
- JWT tokens with refresh mechanism

## Known Issues
(Track bugs and technical debt here)

- None yet (project just initialized)

## Next Steps for Future Sessions
1. Implement auth-magic-link-request (Priority 1)
2. Implement auth-magic-link-verify (Priority 1)
3. Implement auth-guest-name-entry (Priority 1)
4. Implement groups-create-basic (Priority 1)
5. Set up database and run initial migrations

## Session: 2025-11-28 (Session 2)
Working on: auth-magic-link-request
Description: User can request a magic link by entering their email address

### auth-magic-link-request - COMPLETE
- Implemented:
  - NestJS auth module with AuthService and AuthController
  - Magic link entity for storing tokens
  - POST /auth/magic-link/request endpoint
  - POST /auth/magic-link/verify endpoint
  - Mobile sign-in screen with email input
  - Magic link sent confirmation screen
  - Auth store with API integration
  - Root layout with auth flow protection
- Verified:
  - API endpoint returns success message
  - Email validation works (rejects invalid emails)
  - Magic link token is generated and logged
  - Token verification returns user and accessToken
- Commit: 9c98a71
- Notes: Using in-memory storage for now, will migrate to TypeORM later

### auth-magic-link-verify - INCOMPLETE
- Backend endpoint implemented: POST /auth/magic-link/verify works
- Mobile verifyMagicLink() store function exists
- MISSING: Deep linking URL scheme not configured in app.json
- MISSING: No code to handle incoming magic link URLs
- MISSING: No screen to process magic link tokens from URLs
- Status: Only API side complete, mobile deep linking flow not implemented

## Session: 2025-11-28 (Session 3)
Working on: auth-magic-link-verify
Description: User can authenticate by clicking the magic link in their email

### auth-magic-link-verify - COMPLETE
- Implemented:
  - Deep linking URL scheme configured in app.json (scheme: "evn")
  - Created auth/verify.tsx screen to handle magic link tokens
  - Updated root layout to allow auth/verify route without authentication
  - Deep link URL format: evn://auth/verify?token=xxx
- Tests added:
  - apps/api/src/auth/__tests__/auth.controller.spec.ts (8 tests)
    - Valid token verification returns user + accessToken
    - Invalid token rejection
    - Already-used token rejection
    - Same user returned for same email
    - Empty token rejection
- Verified:
  - API endpoint verifies tokens correctly
  - Mobile app has deep link configuration
  - Session persists via AsyncStorage (zustand persist middleware)
- Commit: 2ccc00f
- Notes: Full E2E testing requires running on device/simulator to test deep links

## Session: 2025-11-28 (Session 4)
Working on: auth-guest-name-entry
Description: Guest user can join a group by entering only their name

### auth-guest-name-entry - COMPLETE
- Implemented:
  - API: POST /auth/guest endpoint with name and deviceId params
  - GuestAuthDto with validation (name required, deviceId required, name trimming)
  - AuthService.createGuestUser() stores guest users by device ID
  - Mobile: guest-join.tsx screen with name input form
  - Mobile: Updated sign-in.tsx "Continue as guest" to navigate to guest-join
  - Mobile: authStore.loginAsGuest() calls API and stores session
  - Device ID generation and persistence via AsyncStorage
- Tests added:
  - apps/api/src/auth/__tests__/guest-auth.controller.spec.ts (8 tests)
    - Create guest user with name and device ID
    - Return existing guest for same device ID
    - Update name on re-registration
    - Empty name rejection
    - Missing name rejection
    - Empty device ID rejection
    - Missing device ID rejection
    - Whitespace trimming on name
- Verified:
  - All 17 API tests pass (9 magic link + 8 guest auth)
  - Mobile TypeScript compiles without errors
- Status: Feature complete
