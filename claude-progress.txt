## Architecture Decisions
(Document key decisions here as they're made)

### AD-001: Monorepo Structure
- Using Turborepo for build orchestration
- apps/mobile (Expo), apps/web (Vite React), apps/api (NestJS)
- packages/shared for business logic reuse

### AD-002: State Management
- Zustand for client state (lightweight, simple API)
- WatermelonDB for local-first offline storage
- WebSocket for real-time sync

### AD-003: Styling
- NativeWind (Tailwind for React Native) on mobile
- Tailwind CSS on web
- Shared design tokens via packages/config

### AD-004: Authentication
- Magic link as primary auth for account creators
- Name-only guest auth for frictionless invites
- JWT tokens with refresh mechanism

## Known Issues
(Track bugs and technical debt here)

- None yet (project just initialized)

## Next Steps for Future Sessions
1. Implement auth-magic-link-request (Priority 1)
2. Implement auth-magic-link-verify (Priority 1)
3. Implement auth-guest-name-entry (Priority 1)
4. Implement groups-create-basic (Priority 1)
5. Set up database and run initial migrations
