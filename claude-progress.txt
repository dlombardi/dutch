## Architecture Decisions
(Document key decisions here as they're made)

### AD-001: Monorepo Structure
- Using Turborepo for build orchestration
- apps/mobile (Expo), apps/web (Vite React), apps/api (NestJS)
- packages/shared for business logic reuse

### AD-002: State Management
- Zustand for client state (lightweight, simple API)
- WatermelonDB for local-first offline storage
- WebSocket for real-time sync

### AD-003: Styling
- NativeWind (Tailwind for React Native) on mobile
- Tailwind CSS on web
- Shared design tokens via packages/config

### AD-004: Authentication
- Magic link as primary auth for account creators
- Name-only guest auth for frictionless invites
- JWT tokens with refresh mechanism

## Known Issues
(Track bugs and technical debt here)

- None yet (project just initialized)

## Next Steps for Future Sessions
1. Implement auth-magic-link-request (Priority 1)
2. Implement auth-magic-link-verify (Priority 1)
3. Implement auth-guest-name-entry (Priority 1)
4. Implement groups-create-basic (Priority 1)
5. Set up database and run initial migrations

## Session: 2025-11-28 (Session 2)
Working on: auth-magic-link-request
Description: User can request a magic link by entering their email address

- Commit: 9c98a71
- Notes: Using in-memory storage for now, will migrate to TypeORM later

### auth-magic-link-verify - INCOMPLETE
- Backend endpoint implemented: POST /auth/magic-link/verify works
- Mobile verifyMagicLink() store function exists
- MISSING: Deep linking URL scheme not configured in app.json
- MISSING: No code to handle incoming magic link URLs
- MISSING: No screen to process magic link tokens from URLs
- Status: Only API side complete, mobile deep linking flow not implemented
